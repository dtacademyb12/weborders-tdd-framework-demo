TDD - Test Driven Development (it is NOT DDT(Data-driven testing))  - a practice of writing tests before the code
TDD Test Automation Framework - a framework that uses TestNG or Junit to write the tests and wher you can write the functional tests before the functionality is ready

TDD Framework Building Steps:

1. Create a maven project
2. Add project specific dependencies and plugins (surefire)
3. Create a package structure
4. Add project specific .gitignore file
5. Add the utility classes
6. Add the TestBase class with necessary before and after methods and extend your test classes from it
7. Add the testng.xml file to configure a specific test run (regression.xml, smoke.xml)
8. Configure the surefire plugin to be able to run tests (specific xml files) through command line
9. Create a Driver class with singleton design pattern to prevent multiple initialization of webdriver object (browser)
